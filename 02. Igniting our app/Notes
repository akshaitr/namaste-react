1.  To make our app production ready what should we do?

- Minify our file (Remove console logs, bundle things up)
  Minify â€”> Optimization â€”> Clean console â€”> Bundle
- Need a server to run things

2.  What are bundlers?

- A bundler is a tool that bundles our app, packages our app so that it can be shipped to production.
- Examples of Bundlers:

  - Webpack
  - Vite
  - Parcel

    ðŸ“¢ NOTE: In create-react-app, the bundler used is webpack.

3.  What is a package manager?

- Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our code, we have to use a package manager.
- Examples of package managers:
  - npm
  - yarn

4.  What is difference between package.json and package-lock.json?

In package.json we have information about generic version of installed packages whereas in
package-lock.json we have information about the specific or exact version of installed packages.

5.  What is difference between dependencies and devDependencies?

Dependencies are the crucial packages required for your application to function in a production
environment. DevDependencies are tools and utilities that aid in the development process but are not
needed in production.

    ðŸ“¢ NOTE: Transitive dependencies

6.  Why should we not modify package-lock.json?

package-lock.json file maintains the exact version of the packages in this file to make sure everyone
has the same version of packages installed on their computers so that it works perfectly fine on all
computers.

    ðŸ“¢ NOTE: Treat package-lock.json as a valuable blueprint, not a playground for manual changes.

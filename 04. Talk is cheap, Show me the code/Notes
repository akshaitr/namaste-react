1. Config driven UI

It is a user Interface that is built and configured using a declaration configuration
file or data structure, rather than being hardcoded. Config is the data coming from the
api which keeps on changing according to different factors like user, location, etc.

2. Each item in the list must be uniquely identified. Why?

When we have components at same level and if a new component comes on the first without ID,
DOM is going to re-render all the components again. As DOM canâ€™t identify where to place it.
But if we give each of them a unique ID then react knows where to put that component according
to the ID. It is a good optimization and performance improvement technique.

    ðŸ“¢ NOTE: Never use index as keys in map. It is not recommended.

3. Is JSX mandatory for React?

JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient
when you donâ€™t want to set up compilation in your build environment.

Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).
So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.

4. Is ES6 mandatory for React?

ES6 is not mandatory for React but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React
rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:
Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const). ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created
to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.
